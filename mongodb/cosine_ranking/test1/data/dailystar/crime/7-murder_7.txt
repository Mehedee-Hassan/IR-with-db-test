7-murder verdict: Prosecution demands prompt execution.
Prosecution lawyer of Narayanganj seven-murder case Advocate Sakhawat Hossain today demanded immediate implementation of the verdict that awarded death penalty to 26 people including the prime accused Nur Hossain.

“We want immediate implementation of the verdict,” Sakhawat made the call soon after the verdict was delivered by Sayed Enayet Hossain, judge of Narayanganj District and Sessions Judge's Court.

The court started reading out the verdict amid tight security around 10:03am.

The prosecution expressed satisfaction over the verdict.

Defence unhappy

Meanwhile, defence lawyer of dismissed Rab official Tareque Sayeed said he is not satisfied with the verdict that awarded his client death penalty in the seven-murder case.

“We will appeal to the higher court against the verdict,” Md Sultanujjaman, lawyer of Tareque Sayeed told The Daily Star after the verdict.

“The evidence produced before the court against my client was not enough to prove him guilty,” he added.

Seven people, including Nazrul and senior lawyer Chandan Sarker, were abducted from the Dhaka-Narayanganj link road on April 27, 2014.

Later, their bodies were found floating in the Shitalakkhya river.

Prime accused Nur Hossain, sacked commanding officer of Rab-11 Tareque Sayeed Mohammad and 24 others were awarded death penalty in this connection today.
