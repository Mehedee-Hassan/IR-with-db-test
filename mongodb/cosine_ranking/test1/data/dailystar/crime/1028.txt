Housewife burnt to death for dowry.
A housewife succumbed to her injuries after her husband allegedly set her on fire for dowry in Anantaram village of Rangpur.

The victim was identified as Najma Begum, 25, wife of Russell Mian.

Police said Najma had been married to Russell Mian for five years.

After their marriage, Russell demanded Tk 1 lakh from Najma's parents as dowry. As they failed to meet his demand, Russell used to torture Najma.

On Thursday at about 11:00am, Russell argued with Najma over the issue and beat her up indiscriminately. At one stage, he poured kerosene over Najma and set her on fire, leaving her seriously injured, local sources said.

Hearing her screams, neighbours rushed to the house and took her to Rangpur Medical College Hospital where she died on Thursday evening.

Golam Mostafa, director of Rangpur Medical College Hospital, said she suffered 100 percent burn injuries.

Najmul Islam, victim's younger brother, lodged a case in this connection with Pirgachha Police Station.

Bazlur Rashid, officer-in-charge of the police station, said Russel fled after the incident.

â€œWe have already started looking for him,â€ Bazlur Rashid added.
