Tonu killing: Students threaten hartal Apr 25.
Students have threatened a half-day countrywide hartal (shutdown) for April 25 if killers of Comilla college student Sohagi Jahan Tonu are not arrested.

Two major left-leaning alliances of student bodies have also threatened to pull down the administration if the government remains indifferent in this regard after April 25.

Heightened agitation programme came following days of countrywide agitation, demonstration and protest from students demanding #JusticeForTonu – the girl who was found dead near Comilla cantonment on March 20.

In footsteps to that movement, Progressive Students’ Alliance and Anti-Imperialist Students’ Union began a march from Dhaka University to besiege the home ministry around 12:15am.

Curbed in face of a police barrier at Shikhha Bhaban intersection near the High Court, Ashraful Alam Sohel, coordinator of Progressive Students’ Alliance, announced the shutdown call.

Prior to it, the students marched through Dhaka University campus and broke through three separate layers of barricades between Doyel Chattar and High Court road.

Protest demanding #JusticeForTonu has been bubbling for the last few days and is still the popular topic that is floating around in the social media.

The latest outcry, in social media platforms, has been a denounce of the first forensic report that said doctors did not find any evidence of rape inside Tonu’s body.
