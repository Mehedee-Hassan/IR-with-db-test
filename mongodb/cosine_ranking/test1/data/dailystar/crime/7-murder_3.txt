7-murder: CJ assigns HC bench for hearing death references.
Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha today assigned a High Court bench for hearing the death references and appeals in sensational Narayanganj seven-murder cases.

The bench of Justice Bhabani Prasad Singh and Justice Mustafa Zaman Islam will now fix a date for hearing the death references and appeals of the two cases, additional registrar of the High Court Sabbir Foyez told The Daily Star.

Earlier on Tuesday, another High Court bench of Justice Zahangir Hossain Selim and Justice Mohammad Zahangir Hossain directed the government to appoint a state defence counsel for five absconding death row convicts of the cases.

Earlier on January 16, the District and Sessions Judge's Court in Narayanganj found 35 people, including 25 former Rab officials and expelled ruling Awami League man Nur Hossain, guilty of abduction and murder of seven people and destroying evidence in April 2014.

The court handed down death penalty to 26 people, including 16 former Rapid Action Battalion members, and jailed nine others for various terms.

The bodies of seven people, including Narayanganj City Corporation councillor Nazrul Islam and senior lawyer Chandan Sarker, were found floating in the Shitalakkhya River after they were abducted on April 27, 2014.
