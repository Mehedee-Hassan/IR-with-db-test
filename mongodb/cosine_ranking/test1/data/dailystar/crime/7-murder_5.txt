7-murder won’t affect image of Rab: Benjir.
The seven murder verdict of Narayanganj would not affect the image of the Rapid Action Battalion (Rab), Benazir Ahmed, director general of the elite force, said today.

“They [the Rab officials involved in 7-murder] got punishment for what they did, Rab is not responsible for that,” he said while distributing warm cloths among the distress people at the ground of Rangpur Water Development office.

Being a disciplinary force in the country, Rab also investigated the incident of seven-murder and suspended the accused when the probe team found them guilty, he said.

A Narayanganj court on January 16 found 35 people, including 25 former Rab officials, guilty of abduction and murder of seven people and destroying evidence in April 2014. Of the accused, 26 people were awarded death penalty while nine other accused were jailed for various terms, from seven to 17 years.
