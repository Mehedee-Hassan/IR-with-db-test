Five students detained for 'kidnapping' teacher.
Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) detained five students, four of Jahangirnagar University and one of Dhaka College, and rescued a college teacher, whom they had allegedly kidnapped, from a courier service office in Savar yesterday.

The students claimed that the teacher, Ahsan Habib Prince, of Selima Rahman College in Sundarganj upazila of Gaibandha district, owed one of them Tk 85,000 and that they had not kidnapped him, said police.

â€œWe came to know that the five would come to the courier service office to collect Tk 10 lakh they demanded for the teacher's release,â€ said Capt Tahsin Saleheen of Rab-4.

Rab said Prince was kidnapped from the capital's Shikkha Bhaban on January 11 and kept confined in the university's Al-Beruni Hall.

Rab handed over the students to Savar Police Station last night.
