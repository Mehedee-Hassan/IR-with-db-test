Nothing wrong in Tonu's 1st autopsy report.
Sharmin Sultana, the physician who conducted the first autopsy on the body of Sohagi Jahan Tonu, has claimed that she did not provide any false information in the post-mortem report.

The lecturer of the forensic department at Comilla Medical College Hospital made the claim in reply to legal notices served on her and two other physicians.

Bangladesh National Woman Lawyers' Association (BNWLA) Executive Director advocate Salma Ali, on behalf of Tonu's father Yaar Hossain, sent the notices to the three doctors on May 25, asking why legal action would not be taken against them for not finding any evidence of rape in the first autopsy and for making delay in revealing the second autopsy report.

The two other recipients of the notice are Comilla Medical College Principal Mohsin-uz-Zaman Chowdhury, and Dr Kamoda Proshad Saha, head of the forensic department of the hospital.

Mohsin said they sent the replies in three separate envelops to the Agargaon office of BNWLA yesterday.

In the reply, Sharmin Sultana said she conducted the autopsy on Tonu's body following rules prevailing in all medical colleges of the country and scrutinised the inquest report properly.

She said Sub-inspector Saiful Islam mentioned in the inquest report that the anal and vagina were seen normal. “I reviewed the inquest report and checked the injuries on Tonu's body and prepared the autopsy report in a proper way,” Sharmin said.

She said there were no sign of struggle and marks of violence, the vagina was healthy and no spermatozoa were seen in the microbiological test -- High Vaginal Swab -- for detection of spermatozoa.

“I made the comment that no sign of forceful sexual intercourse before death was found after considering all aspects, including chemical analysis of inquest, histopathological examination of heart and autopsy findings,” the lecturer said, adding that she mentioned in the autopsy report that no definite opinion as to the cause of death could be given following the chemical analysis.

She also said the issue of differences in the two autopsies as mentioned in the legal notice was not right as the second post-mortem report was yet to be published.

In his reply, principal Mohsin said he was not involved in the autopsy, so he had no scope of giving any false report.

On the other hand, Kamoda Proshad said Sharmin conducted the first autopsy and he had no scope for giving any directive in this regard.

He also said the three-member medical board would prepare the second autopsy report once it gets the DNA test from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

Tonu, a student of history at Comilla Victoria College, was found dead in a bush inside Comilla Cantonment on 20 March.

Police suspected that she had been raped before being killed.

Tonu was buried at a grave at Mirzapur in Muradnagar upazila on March 21.

On March 29, Tonu's body was exhumed for second autopsy, as the doctors didn't find any evidence of rape in the first autopsy.

On May 17, the CID disclosed that it found evidence of rape on Tonu's body in its DNA test.
