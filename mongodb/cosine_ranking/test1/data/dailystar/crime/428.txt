Fraud puts international trade at risk.




Companies engaged in international trade are facing growing threat from fraud and forgery and the recent scams in some state banks have shaken private commercial banks, a business leader said.

Now the genuine companies find it hard to access loans from banks, Mahbubur Rahman, president of International Chamber of Commerce Bangladesh (ICCB).

â€œThe commercial banks are also taking extra precautionary measures in opening of LCs, and if this trend continues, the much needed development of the country's industrial base will be in jeopardy,â€ Rahman said.

Rahman spoke at a seminar on "Trade fraud in Bangladesh: challenges and remedies" organised by ICCB at the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry auditorium on Wednesday.

"The recent scam is nothing but a straight cheating by some so-called companies in connivance with a group of bank officials and influential group," he said in a statement yesterday.

Bangladesh Bank must be given full autonomy to monitor the activities of state banks like private commercial banks, he said.

There should not be any interference of the Banking Division of the finance ministry to operate the state banks, Rahman said, adding that Bangladesh Bank and all commercial (both public and private) banks should also develop modern fraud detection mechanism and take early action.

Bangladesh has been growing fast in the international trade. Both import and export are increasing at substantial rate. Bangladesh is now considered to be an emerging trading nation with a trade volume of $60 billion.

As the international trade is growing, all parties involved in the trade are also getting exposed to the risk of fraud, Rahman said. â€œThe more the market of import-export is expanding the more we are facing the risk of unknown events including fraud."

It is important to recognise that domestic and international financial liberalisation heighten the â€œrisk of crisisâ€ if not supported by prudent supervision, regulation and appropriate macroeconomic management, he said.

The global financial crisis has created an urgent need to fundamentally rethink how financial systems should function and how it should be regulated.

DCCI President Asif Ibrahim said the country has been maintaining a steady growth despite high interest rate, energy crisis toppled with street agitation and frequent hartals. "It has been possible only due to the vibrant private sector who deserves the credit for being the engine of growth."

He suggested the age-old policies should be replaced with new and pro-active ones to create a more investment-friendly environment to attract both local and foreign investment.

He said the investment level should be increased from present 6-8 percent of GDP to 25-35 percent over the next few years to achieve a higher GDP growth rate. BIBM Director Toufic A Choudhury said higher rate of document rejection has become apparent following current economic crisis and fall in commodity prices.

In the context of Bangladesh, there are instances where banks reject documents just for rejection and charges for the discrepancies as their foreign counterparts do, he said. "These are clear departures from the UCP morals. Such practices can simply make the trade costlier and burdensome to the consumers."

To retain the clients in this competitive market, banks sometimes undertake undue risks even bypassing the regulatory framework which may harm the banking sector, he cautioned.

"Banking scam is not new in our country, but the difference is that in the past it was limited to only four to five accounts and now-a-days it is 30-60 accounts," said former Sonali Bank managing director Mohammad Hossain.

"So, it may be assumed that a substantial portion of banking loan has been disbursed fraudulently which is alarming for the industrial sector."
