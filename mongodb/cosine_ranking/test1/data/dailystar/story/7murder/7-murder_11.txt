Appoint defence counsel for absconding 7-murder death row convicts, HC to govt.
The High Court today directed the government to appoint the state defence counsel for five absconding death-row convicts of the sensational Narayanganj seven-murder cases.

The solicitor wing of the law ministry has been asked to hire the state defence lawyer within seven days.

The bench of Justice Jahangir Hossain Selim and Justice Md Jahangir Hossain passed the order while dealing with the death reference, and appeals filed by the arrested convicts in this case.

The judges, however, did not specifically say the solicitor wing will recruit one or multiple lawyers for the absconding convicts.

The court did not fix any date for holding hearing on the death reference and appeals of the cases.

The five fugitive death-row convicts of the cases areâ€”Md Mohiuddin Munshi, Al Amin Sharif, Md Tajul Islam, Md Sanaullah alias Sana and Shahjahan, court sources said.

The paper books of the Narayanganj seven-murder cases reached the HC on May 7 from the Bangladesh Government Press for hearing their death references and appeals.
