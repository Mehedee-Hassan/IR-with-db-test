He also said the incident of the seven-murder in 2014 was a pre-planned killing.

On November 30 last year, a Narayanganj court fixed tomorrow [January 16, 2017] for delivering its verdict on the sensational seven murders after the completion of the defence arguments in favour of 23 arrested accused and 12 fugitives.

Seven people, including Narayanganj City Corporation panel mayor Nazrul Islam and senior lawyer Chandan Sarker, were abducted from the Dhaka-Narayanganj link road on April 27, 2014. Later, their bodies were found floating in the Shitalakkhya.

A total of 35 people including the main accused Nur Hossain were indicted in the two cases filed over the incident.
