N'ganj 7-murder: Convicted 'fugitive' in police job!.
It sounds bizarre, but it is true.

Habibur Rahman Habib, a former Rab man, was among the 35 accused in the sensational seven-murder case in Narayanganj.

A Narayanganj court in January found all the accused guilty and jailed Habib for 17 years on charges of abduction and destroying evidence.

But Habib had continued his job at a police outpost in Barisal's Hizla upazila as an assistant sub-inspector before police arrested him yesterday.

Md Masuduzzaman, officer-in-charge of Hizla Police Station, said the ASI of Tak Naval Outpost was arrested there around 4:00pm.

Habib from Shariatpur's Naria upazila previously served Chittagong Metropolitan Police as a constable. He was transferred to the outpost and was promoted to ASI about six months ago, the OC told The Daily Star.

Ekram Ali Mia, OC of Naria Police Station, said they received an arrest warrant from the Narayanganj court on March 14.

Yesterday, they with the help of Hizla police picked up Habib after getting information about his whereabouts.

The arrestee would be sent to jail through a court, Ekram added.

According to a police official, the arrestee was the gunman of then company commander of Rab-11 Lt Commander Masud Rana (sacked). Rana was handed down death penalty.

Seven people, including then Narayanganj City Corporation panel mayor Nazrul Islam and senior lawyer Chandan Sarker, were abducted from Dhaka-Narayanganj Link Road on April 27, 2014. Later, their bodies were found floating in the Shitalakkhya river.

On July 8, 2015, the Narayanganj court issued arrest warrants for 13 fugitives, including eight Rab men. The court on February 8 last year framed charges against the 35 accused.

On January 16 this year, the Narayanganj District and Sessions Judge's Court handed down death sentences to 26 accused and jailed nine others for various terms ranging from seven to 17 years. Habib was tried in absentia.

Of the 12 fugitive convicts, three surrendered or were arrested by law enforcers after the pronouncement of the verdict.

Sakhawat Hossain, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, was stunned to know that Habib was in his job even after being convicted.

He said as per the legal procedure, advertisements were published in national dailies asking all the fugitives to appear before the court after it took the charges brought against them into cognisance.

The court later decided to hold the trial of the fugitives in absentia.

“How could the man continue his job? He was supposed to be suspended right away after his indictment,” the lawyer said.

A departmental probe must be launched against Habib to find out how he could continue his job, Sakhawat added.
